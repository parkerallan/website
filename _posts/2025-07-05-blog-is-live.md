## Welcome to My Blog!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm excited to finally have a proper blog up and running where I can share my thoughts, projects, and experiences. I think alot of what I want to discuss here will transcend just development/design efforts. I want to share more of my process for studying new concepts and applying them through various projects.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Development Projects** - What I'm currently working on
- **Learning Experiences** - Technologies or interests I'm exploring
- **Problem-solving** - Approaches and challenges that others can learn from

## About Me

I talking about this more in my main "about me" section, but I'm a Software Development Engineer in Test with 4+ years experience in QA, Automation, AI, and the software development space as whole. I've started to branch out into more hardware work with FPGA design and embedded systems. I also like to put out many personal projects whether they are music, games, software and hopefully some FPGA designs soon. I love diving into complex engineering problems and creating an end product.

## What's Coming Next

Some topics I'll be posting here in the coming weeks:
- Releasing my Unity 3D game and lessons learned (my biggest project yet - 6+ months in the making)
- Creating my first processor design and lessons learned
